**Sanctuary OS** is a comprehensive environmental monitoring and management system designed specifically for wildlife conservation facilities. Built by [Absurd Industries](https://absurd.industries) in collaboration with [The Liana Trust](https://www.thelianatrust.org/), UI design by [Code Uncode](https://codeuncode.com) this platform transforms traditional habitat monitoring into an intelligent, real-time conservation tool.

## üêç **The Problem We're Solving**

Wildlife conservation facilities face critical challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions for their residents:

- **Manual monitoring** is time-intensive and prone to human error
- **Environmental fluctuations** can be life-threatening for ectothermic species
- **Data collection** is often fragmented across multiple systems
- **Emergency response** requires immediate awareness of critical changes
- **Research documentation** needs consistent, accurate environmental data

Traditional monitoring methods simply can't provide the granular, real-time data required for modern conservation science.
